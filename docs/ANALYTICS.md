## Traffic from different releases
Our releases are currently split as
> /StockFlux/RELEASE_TYPE/index.html

Practical examples of this are:

> /StockFlux/master/index.html

> /StockFlux/dev/index.html

> /StockFlux/10.1.0/index.html

GA treats different directories separately, giving us what pages where accessed in which release.

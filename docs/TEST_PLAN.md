# Test Plan
## Assumptions/Luxuries
You should really run full view tests using the full screen of the computer being tested AND also at a reduced size of perhaps 50% of the screen size to improve the quality of the results
The assumption is that right click is disabled and in any instance should always produce no effect.
Hover on means to move mouse cursor over an element.
Hover off means to move mouse cursor off an element.

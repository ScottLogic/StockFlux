OpenFin Questions
-------------------

How does one create properly the exe? (The online way only runs the OpenFin demo.)

How can one download and run the app without having any internet connection?

`autofocus` doesn't work in OpenFin, but does in the browser.

Why does using `grunt watch` after `openfin:serve` not work, but it does the other way round?

Does OpenFin look at the `<object>` element to run, so can create two instances when importing, e.g. an SVG?

OpenFin doesn't get on with `<iframe>`s it seems, and won't allow for easy creation of a minimize button.

The example on the website (particularly "Getting Started") are mostly broken.

### Branching Workflow and deployment

This project uses the [GitFlow]([https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) approach to branching. Please create a local fork of the project to base pull requests off. Development work should occur on feature branches off the `dev` or the related release branch. The main branches are described below and these are deployed to gh-pages as part of the travis build.

| Branch | Notes | Deployed on gh-pages |
|---|---|---|
|master| This is the current live version | Deployed as master and ​_version_​ |
| dev | The current development branch | Deployed as dev
| release-* |  A release branch for a pending release. This should be created from dev and merged in to master and dev once at the point of the release. | ​_version_​-rc |

​_\*version_​ is from package.json

* Feature branches should be deleted as soon as the Pull Request is merged.
* Release branches should be deleted once merged to master and dev.



#### Git Commit Messages

Please follow the [AngularJS commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines) for the commit message format.
This simplifies the generation of the change log for a release.


## Creating a release

Create locally a new branch based off `dev`, named `release-x.x.x`.
On this branch update the version in `package.json` to match the release number
and commit the change with the version as the commit message.
Push the branch to the upstream repository (provided you have write permission)
and open PR for this branch into `dev` and `master` branches.
Once the build has passed you can merge both PRs.
Travis should do the deployment(s) automatically.
The release candidate can be found at
[http://scottlogic.github.io/StockFlux/11.2.0-rc/install.html](http://scottlogic.github.io/StockFlux/x.x.x-rc/install.html)
Now checkout to the `master` branch locally, tag the release
`git tag -a x.x.x -m "x.x.x"` and push the tag to the upstream repository
`git push origin x.x.x`
On github go to [releases](https://github.com/ScottLogic/StockFlux/releases),
check that the tag appears at the top of the timeline.
Click on `Draft a new release`, fill the form and confirm by clicking on
`Publish release`

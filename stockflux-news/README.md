## StockFlux News

StockFlux News is a part of StockFlux app suite intended to work with StockFlux Launcher, Chart, and Watchlist apps.
News is an app used to search for news stories related to a symbol. Each news story can be clicked on and will open in a secure iFrame that has no access to the Openfin API.

### Launching StockFlux News app from the installer

Download the [installer](https://install.openfin.co/download/?os=win&config=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v92tgq94yxaa.cloudfront.net%2Fapi%2Fapps%2Fv1%2Fstockflux-launcher%2Fapp.json&fileName=stockflux-installer&unzipped=true). After installing `StockFlux Launcher` icon should appear on the desktop. Double click it to open the StockFlux Launcher.

StockFlux News can be launched from the launcher app:

- by clicking on StockFlux News app icon in the top left corner of the launcher
- by searching for a symbol using launcher's input field. When the list of symbols loads, click on the news icon of a particular symbol and that will open a new instance of the news app and search for stories related to that symbol.

### Running locally

In order to launch the StockFlux News app locally, StockFlux Core and StockFlux Components have to be built first.

```bash
cd stockflux-core
npm run build
cd stockflux-components
npm run build
```

Then install StockFlux News dependencies.

```bash
cd stockflux-news
npm install
```

To start and launch the StockFlux News:

```bash
npm start
npm run launch
```

Unfortunately at the time of writing, the news application will only search for a symbol if it is provided over the Openfin InterApplicationBus.
Work is planned to include a search bar to allow the application to function standalone.

To launch other StockFlux apps locally read the `README.md` files in the project folders.
